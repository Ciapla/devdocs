Running the Safe Upgrade Tool (SUT) helps you identify what you must do **before** upgrading Magento.

The minimum requirements to run the SUT are:

| **Requirements** | **Constraints** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| PHP version| >= 7.3 |
| Composer | none |
| Node.js | none |
| Magento Access keys | none |
| MC or Magento Open Source | none |
{:style="table-layout:auto;"}

You can run the SUT in any operating system. There is no requirement to run the SUT where your Magento instance is located. For example, you can install SUT in another server, and run it against where your magento instance is located.

Refer to the [SUT installation]({{page.baseurl}}/sut/install.html#install).
