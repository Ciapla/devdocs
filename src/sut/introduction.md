SUT is a CLI tool that checks a magento instance against a specific version by analysing all the non-magento modules installed in it.

SUT identifies which potential problems you have to fix within your customized code when trying to upgrade to a newer magento version.

Running the tool will return a list of errors and warnings that you will have to take into account to complete the upgrade to the desired version.

Refer to the [SUT installation guide]({{page.baseurl}}/sut/install.html) for full instructions on how to install these prerequisites.
